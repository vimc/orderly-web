# OrderlyWeb API

# General points
* By default data returned is in JSON format, and POST and PUT data is expected 
  as a string containing JSON-formatted data. Some endpoints return other data
  as described in the individual endpoint descriptions.
* Dates and times are returned as strings according to the ISO 8601 standard.
* Unless otherwise noted, URLs and IDs embedded in URLs are case-sensitive.
* You must include the correct accept-header for each request: `application/json` for 
  json endpoints and `text/csv` for csv endpoints. If your accept-header is incorrectly 
  set for the endpoint you are accessing, you may get a `Error: Unknown resource. 
  Please check the URL` even though your URL may be correct.
* All API endpoints can be found relative to `https://[base-url]/api/[version]`, where `[base-url]` is the home url for the 
  OrderlyWeb web portal, and `[version]` is the required version of the api.
* The only available version currently is `v1` so all api endpoints can be found relative to
  `https://[base-url]/api/v1/` e.g. `https://[base-url]/api/v1/reports/`
* API endpoints can be accessed with or without trailing slashes e.g. both `https://[base-url]/api/v1/reports/` and 
  `https://[base-url]/api/v1/reports` will work. 
* Query parameters that accept booleans are case insensitive and accept `true` and `false`.
* Authentication is via tokens issued by the Montagu API or by GitHub (see [below](#post-login) for details).
* For each endpoint, if the user does not have the `reports.review` permission then only published report versions' data 
will be accessible. If the user does have `reports.review` then both published and unpublished report versions will be accessible. 
* In addition, users may have permission scoped at the report level, and will not be able to access reports for which they
do not have read or review permission.   

# Standard response format
All responses are returned in a standard format. Throughout this specification, 
wherever an endpoint describes its response format, it should be assumed the payload is wrapped in
the standard response format, so that the `data` property holds the payload.

## Success
Schema: [`Response.schema.json`](Response.schema.json)

### Example
    {
        "status": "success",
        "data": {},
        "errors": []
    }

## Error
Schema: [`Response.schema.json`](Response.schema.json)

### Example
    {
        "status": "failure",
        "data": null,
        "errors": [
            { 
                "code": "unique-error-code", 
                "message": "Full, user-friendly error message" 
            }
        ]
    }

# Standard response codes
The complete list of HTTP status codes returned by the API is:
* 200 - OK
* 201 - Object successfully created
* 400 - Bad request
* 404 - Resource not found. This will be returned both when the url is not part of the spec,
and when a requested resource does not exist 
* 401 - Unauthorized - User is not logged in
* 403 - Forbidden - User does not have required permissions
* 409 - Conflict. This will be returned when the user's request attempts to insert an object into
the database with a primary key that already exists.
* 500 - Internal server error - This generally indicates an unexpected error has occurred. 

*Note that we use 400 liberally to indicate when submitted data
does not conform to expected OrderlyWeb conventions, as well as for invalid operation
 requests.

#Endpoints
## POST /login/
To login and retrieve a bearer token that can be used to authenticate all other requests
users will need either a GitHub token or a Montagu token, depending on which provider the app is configured to run with.
 
To authenticate with GitHub, first create a limited scope GitHub token by going [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
and choosing `read:user` and `user:email` under section `user` as the only selected scopes.

To authenticate with Montagu, first retrieve a Montatgu token by following the instructions 
[here](https://github.com/vimc/montagu-api/blob/master/docs/spec/Authentication.md#post-authenticate)

Once you have a token from the appropriate provider, make a POST request to `/login/` sending request header 
`Authorization: token MONTAGU_OR_GITHUB_TOKEN`

Like so:

    POST /login/ HTTP/1.1
    Host: server.example.com
    Authorization: token czZCaGRSa3F0MzpnWDFmQmF0M2JW
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

### Response
If you provide a valid Montagu or GitHub token (for GitHub you must also be a member of the configured org and
 optionally, team) then an OrderlyWeb access_token is returned that can be used in future
requests. Include the access token using the Authorization
header with the format `Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN` in future requests to
other  endpoints.

Schema: [`LoginSuccessful.schema.json`](../schemas/LoginSuccessful.schema.json)

#### Example

    {
        "access_token": "2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA",
        "token_type": "bearer",
        "expires_in": 3600
    }

Otherwise an error response is returned with status code 401 if the token was invalid, or 403 if the authentication 
provider is GitHub and the user is not a member of the configured GitHub organization or team.
